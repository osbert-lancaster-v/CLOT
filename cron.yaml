	schedule: every 6 hours	#You can control here how often your website will check for updates to games.
							#The default is 6 hours. You can adjust it, but do NOT set this to a value 
							#lower than 3 hours. Setting this lower than 3 hours puts strain on the 
							#WarLight.net website, since it has to call the API to get the status of 
							#every active game in your CLOT every time it runs.  Calling the APIs too often
							#will get you in trouble.
